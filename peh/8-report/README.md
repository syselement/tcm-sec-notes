# 8. Legal Documentation & Report Writing

## Common legal documents

➡️ **Sales phase**

Before conducting a penetration test, legal agreements are established to define the relationship between the client and the security testing provider.

- **Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**
  - Ensures confidentiality of sensitive information.
  - Prevents disclosure of client or tester details without consent.
- **Master Service Agreement (MSA)**
  - Defines overall business terms and conditions.
  - Covers liability, payment terms, and service responsibilities.
- **Statement of Work (SOW)**
  - Specifies the scope, objectives, and timeline of the penetration test.
  - Outlines deliverables, methodologies, and exclusions.
- **Other Documents (sample reports, recommendation letters, etc.)**
  - Provides clients with example reports for reference.
  - Includes references or testimonials for credibility.

➡️ **Before you test**

Key agreements set the rules and expectations for how the penetration test will be conducted.

- **Rules of Engagement (ROE)**
  - Defines **testing scope**, authorized attack methods, and limitations.
  - Establishes **acceptable testing hours**, emergency contacts, and data handling rules.
  - Ensures compliance with **legal and ethical guidelines** to avoid unintended damage.

➡️ **After you test**

Once the penetration test is completed, findings and recommendations are documented.

- **Findings report**
  - Summarizes identified vulnerabilities and security gaps.
  - Provides **risk assessments** and prioritization of discovered threats.
  - Includes **remediation recommendations** to improve security.

These documents ensure **legal protection, clear expectations, and structured reporting** throughout the penetration testing lifecycle.
